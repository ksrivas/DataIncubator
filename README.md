# DataIncubator project proposal

The files in this directory are a part of the Data incubator challenge project proposal.
The data set is chosen from the following site http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads.aspx
whose primary motive is to assemble statistics on the accessability of residents in the US
to access healthy food and other utilities.

My proposed project is to provide remote  customers increased access to the nearest stores
by analyzing whether home-delivery services can be provided in counties in the United states 
in which the households rely on public transport for shopping. The aim is to engage  remote 
customers  with their nearest stores by means of simplified online services and possibility 
of providing home-delivery services. My main hypothesis is that counties and states with poor 
accessibility to nearby stores generally would not be attractive for new investments until 
their infrastructure like public transport is expanded. By providing a correlation between 
accessibility and business growth , I intend to highlight on the one hand the need for better
infrastructure but also the potential to exploit   e-commerce by providing home-delivery services 
in such states.

The data set I analyzed is from the United states department of food agriculture and economic 
research service food atlas data collected over the years 2007-2012 on several indicators affecting 
food choices and stores. I performed an exploratory analysis to identify the relationship between 
factors like accessibility to stores and restaurants  and how the growth of new stores and restaurant  
in different states and counties in the United States has occurred in the time-period  2007-2012. 
I looked at the overall growth in stores (convenience and food stores) averaged over counties in 
all the states (excluding Puerto Rico) and also the growth in local businesses. 

My initial analysis suggests that states with low mean accessibility like South Dakota (figure FarmersMarktSDDataCounty.png) have seen a 
decrease in the over number of retail and grocery stores along with the number of new restaurants. It was also detrimental
to local farmers business which showed almost no growth in this state. Comparatively, the data shows that in DC (FarmersMarktDCDataCounty.png) whose 
population has a better proximity to stores, the local businesses showed a large increase in the five year period from 2007 to 2012.

By providing an additional online resource for low-access groups by means of a simplified app  and providing home-delivery services to customers, the stores can increase their revenue and also provide impetus for future growth and investments. The data also provides a means has also potentially long term consequences for government policies  in providing guidance towards building data-informed infrastructure which is beneficial for both citizens and businesses.
